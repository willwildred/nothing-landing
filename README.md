# Nothing Phone Landing Page
Landing about NOTHING PHONE (1), pretty good phone though
<br>
No additional animations was used here, everything from Figma Design
<br>
Tech stack is: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Grid, Flex, a lot of mixins, and BEM
Also, this landing was adapted to mobiles (>320px), tablets and large-sreens (even bigger than shows in Figma)
You can run my project local, for this: you need to install node version v14.21, than install all packages via ~npm install, and run project with ~npm run start.
